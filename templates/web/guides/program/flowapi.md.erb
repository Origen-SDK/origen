The runtime flow control of a test program is an area that can be particularly messy:

* Need to deal with different and often obscure vendor APIs
* It can be very hard to decipher both the intention and the actual behavior
  during code reviews
* It is easy to make mistakes
* Mistakes can be costly - there have been many customer quality
  incidents in the past from missed test caused by errors in flow control

To deal with these problems Origen provides a simple and intuitive API
to describe runtime flow logic:

* Generates legal and battle-tested code
* Takes care of cross-platform implementation
* Makes flow control easy to review
* Covers over gaps or weaknesses in the vendor APIs

Conditional tests fall into two categories:

* Those that will run based on the flow execution environment. For example based on
  the job selected at runtime or on some enable flag that can be set by the user at
  runtime.
* Those that will only run based on the outcome of another test - i.e. execute a given
  test based on whether a previous test passed, failed or ran at all.

#### Execution Based on the Runtime Environment   

The following methods are available to describe these cases:

* **if_enable / unless_enable** - Run the test if a flow runtime option is/is not enabled at runtime
* **if_job / unless_job** - Run based on the current job (P1, FR, QC, etc)

Here are some examples of how to apply these methods to single tests:

~~~ruby
# Run this test to characterize the vreg, only if the 'vreg_cz' flag has been enabled
para :vreg_meas, softbin: 107, cz: true, if_enable: "vreg_cz"
# Apply HVST to the vreg module, unless the 'skip_hvst' flag has been enabled
func :vreg_hvst, softbin: 101, hv: 10.V, vdd: :max, unless_enable: "skip_hvst"
# Run this test only at cold
para :vreg_meas, softbin: 105, lo: 1.12, hi: 1.34V, if_job: "FC"
~~~

For an IG-XL based tester this would generate code like this:

~~~text
# Label           Job        Enable         Test
                             vreg_cz        Characterize    vreg_meas char    107
                             skip_hvst      goto            VREG_LABEL_1
                                            Test            vreg_hvst_max     101
VREG_LABEL_1                                nop                      
                  FC                        Test            vreg_meas         105
~~~

The unless "skip_hvst" is enabled is a good example of where Origen patches around
weaknesses in the underlying vendor API - IG-XL doesn't provide a native !enabled
control, however you can write your flow as if it does and Origen will generate
the equivalent logic.

#### Execution Based on a Previous Test

The following methods are available to describe these cases:

* **if_ran / unless_ran** - Run only if a previous test did or did not run
* **if_failed (unless_passed)** - Run only if a previous test failed (site specific)
* **if_passed (unless_failed)** - Run only if a previous test passed (site specific)

All of these methods require you to provide the ID of the previous test on which
the conditional execution will depend.
This ID must be assigned by you in the flow line of the previous test by adding
and <code>id</code> key like this:

~~~ruby
para :vreg_meas, softbin: 105, lo: 1.12, hi: 1.34, id: :vreg_meas_1
~~~

The ID can be any value you like as long as it is unique, Origen will raise an error
if any duplicate IDs are encountered.

On the dependent tests the API is similar to the previous examples except the ID
of the previous test is given in place of the enable flag or job name.
Here are some examples:

~~~ruby
para :vreg_meas, softbin: 105, lo: 1.12, hi: 1.34, id: :vreg_meas_1
# Automatically characterize the vreg if the measurement fails
para :vreg_meas, softbin: 107, cz: true, if_failed: :vreg_meas_1
# Then bin out
bin_out softbin: 105, if_failed: :vreg_meas_1
# Check if the HVST has already been run on this device
func :rd_vreg_hvst_passcode, softbin: 50, vdd: :nom, id: :vreg_hvst_done
# If not run it
func :vreg_hvst, softbin: 101, hv: 10.V, vdd: :max, unless_passed: :vreg_hvst_done
# And program the flag for next time
func :pgm_vreg_hvst_passcode, softbin: 51, vdd: :nom, unless_passed: :vreg_hvst_done
~~~

For an IG-XL based tester this would generate code like this:

~~~text
# Test                                   Result                          Condition
Test            vreg_meas                None    vreg_meas_1_FAILED      
Characterize    vreg_meas char           Fail                            flag-true vreg_meas_1_FAILED
Set-Device      105                                                      flag-true vreg_meas_1_FAILED 
Test            rd_vreg_hvst_passcode    None    vreg_hvst_done_PASSED  
Test            vreg_hvst                Fail                            flag-true vreg_hvst_done_PASSED
Test            pgm_vreg_hvst_passcode   Fail                            flag-true vreg_hvst_done_PASSED
~~~

Origen automatically takes care of setting up all of the tests in the relationship:

* The parent tests in the relationship are automatically set to continue on fail
* Flag(s) will be set to indicate whether the parent test passed or failed
* Conditional execution flags are set on all dependent tests

#### Controlling the Execution of a Group of Tests

All of the flow control methods have a block form which will apply the
condition to all tests within the block.

The previous example could be more clearly written using the block form:

~~~ruby
para :vreg_meas, softbin: 105, lo: 1.12, hi: 1.34, id: :vreg_meas_1
if_failed :vreg_meas_1 do
  # Automatically characterize the vreg if the measurement fails
  para :vreg_meas, softbin: 107, cz: true
  # Then bin out
  bin_out softbin: 105
end
# Check if the HVST has already been run on this device
func :rd_vreg_hvst_passcode, softbin: 50, vdd: :nom, id: :vreg_hvst_done
unless_passed :vreg_hvst_done do
  # If not run it
  func :vreg_hvst, softbin: 101, hv: 10.V, vdd: :max
  # And program the flag for next time
  func :pgm_vreg_hvst_passcode, softbin: 51, vdd: :nom
end
~~~

This will generate the exact same code as before.

A very useful pattern is to split your code into small re-usable snippets
and then wrap the import with these flow control methods to apply conditional
execution.
For example here the 'FH' job requirement will be applied to all tests
imported from the vreg component:

~~~ruby
# Only run the vreg tests at hot
if_job "FH" do
  import "components/vreg"
end
~~~

#### Skipping a Section

An additional method <code>skip</code> is available to skip over a section, this
would normally be qualified by one of the other flow control methods:

~~~ruby
# Don't bother running the hot vreg flow if the device already received it at probe
func :rd_hot_sort2_passcode, softbin: 50, vdd: :nom, id: :hot_sort2_done
skip if_passed: :hot_sort2_done do
  if_job "FH" do
    import "components/vreg"
  end
end
~~~
