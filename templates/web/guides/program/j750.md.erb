Be sure to read and understand the guide to
[Creating an Interface](<%= path "guides/program/interface" %>) before
reading this section.
This guide will describe the API to generate J750/IG-XL test program 
components from within an interface file.

To re-cap this is the shell required to implement an interface: 

~~~ruby
# lib/vreg/interface.rb
module Vreg
  class Interface
    include OrigenTesters::ProgramGenerators

    # An example method that can be called from your test flow to generate a functional test
    def func(name, options={})
      # If your interface supports multiple platforms, add conditional logic like this, if you
      # only ever want to support one platform then you don't need this
      if tester.j750?
        # Functional test implementation for J750
      elsif tester.v93k?
        # Functional test implementation for V93K
      end
    end

  end
end
~~~

The <code>OrigenTesters::ProgramGenerators</code> will provide the interface
with access to all of the platform generator APIs for the platforms that it supports.

If your interface supports multiple platforms then add conditional logic to separate
them as shown above.

### Creating a Test Instance

When generating a J750 program most of the effort is in generating the test
instances. To start with the basic method of creating and decorating test instance
objects will be discussed and then at the end of this section some recommendations
will be given on how to structure your test instance generation methods.

The method <code>test_instances</code> returns an instance of
<code>OrigenTesters::IGXLBasedTester::J750::TestInstances</code> which provides additional
methods to generate new test instances.
The [API](http://origen-sdk.org/testers/api/OrigenTesters/IGXLBasedTester/J750/TestInstances.html)
should be consulted for the most up to date information on the methods available.

A new test instance can be instantiated like this:

~~~ruby
test_instances.add(:vreg_func, :functional)
~~~

This one line of code does a lot of things:

* Creates a new test instance sheet if one doesn't exist already
* Instantiates a new test instance object
* Sets its name to 'vreg_func'
* Applies the default attributes for a J750 functional test instance
  (basically the same attributes that would be present when you added a new functional
  test instance within IG-XL)
* Adds the new test instance to the test instance sheet  

If you were to add that line and generate your program you would now get
a test instance sheet generated with a single functional test instance in it
called 'vreg_func'. Not bad.

Convenience methods exist where you can call a method named after the type of the test instance,
this is equivalent:

~~~ruby
test_instances.functional(:vreg_func)
~~~

You will of course want to decorate your new test instance with attributes that are specific
to your application, to do that you simply assign the returned instance to a variable and
then you can programmatically set the attributes that you want.
For example:

~~~ruby
ins = test_instances.functional(:vreg_func)
ins.ac_category = "Spec"
ins.ac_selector = "Default"
ins.time_sets = "Tim"
ins.pin_levels = "Lvl"
~~~

The name of these methods is the underscored (to align with general Ruby conventions)
version of the name in the IG-XL columns headers and they should hopefully be very
intuitive.

Note that you don't need to do anything here to save or push the instance into the sheet,
this will all be done automatically.

Attributes can also be passed in when instantiating the new instance, this is equivalent
if you prefer:

~~~ruby
ins = test_instances.functional :vreg_func, ac_category: "Spec",
                                            ac_selector: "Default",
                                            time_sets: "Tim",
                                            pin_levels: "Lvl"
~~~

#### Instance Type Specific Attributes

Additional methods will be available depending on the instance type that you
specified.
For example in our functional instance we can set the pattern and call a pre-test
interpose function like this:

~~~ruby
ins.pattern = "vreg_functional"
ins.pre_test_func = "someInterposeFunc"
~~~

Again the method names should hopefully be intuitive and should correspond to
the IG-XL names.

To see what the method names are called refer to the <code>TEST_INSTANCE_ALIASES</code> constant
definition at the top of the
[J750 TestInstance API](http://origen-sdk.org/testers/api/OrigenTesters/IGXLBasedTester/J750/TestInstance.html).

#### Supported Test Instance Types

Currently supported test instance types are (although check the
[API](http://origen-sdk.org/testers/api/OrigenTesters/IGXLBasedTester/J750/TestInstances.html) for the latest
information):

* functional
* board_pmu (bpmu)
* pin_pmu (ppmu)
* other
* empty

If you need a different type you can still call the add method, the difference in the
returned instance for an unrecognized type is:

* The instance will be completely empty and all attributes will need to be
  added by your application code.
* The named attribute methods will not be available. 

The latter means that instead of using convenience methods to set the attributes you
will need to use argX format instead, where argX corresponds to the column name
in IG-XL.

So the previous example of adding a pattern and interpose function call to our functional
instance could be re-written as shown below:

~~~ruby
ins.arg0 = "vreg_functional"
ins.arg3 = "someInterposeFunc"
~~~

You would also need to configure the basic attributes such as the template type and name.
To get an idea of what is required refer to the <code>TEST_INSTANCE_DEFAULTS</code> constant
definition near the top of the
[J750 TestInstance API](http://origen-sdk.org/testers/api/OrigenTesters/IGXLBasedTester/J750/TestInstance.html).

If you do find yourself in this situation please get in touch via 
[the community channels](<%= path "community" %>) and
we can quickly work with you to add the new instance type to Origen, then the names attribute
methods will be available for everyone.

#### What Are the Defaults?

Generally the test instance defaults should match exactly what you get from IG-XL (that is
the intention at least).

To see what the defaults are for a given test instance type refer to the <code>TEST_INSTANCE_DEFAULTS</code> constant
definition near the top of the
[J750 TestInstance API](http://origen-sdk.org/testers/api/OrigenTesters/IGXLBasedTester/J750/TestInstance.html).

#### Helper Methods

A number of helper methods are available to make test instance generation easier.

A good example is setting the current range of a parametric test instance where the value
stored in the IG-XL workbook is not at all intuitive and bears little resemblance to the numeric
range value that it represents.
A [set_irange](http://origen-sdk.org/testers/api/OrigenTesters/IGXLBasedTester/Base/TestInstance.html#set_irange-instance_method)
method is available to help, here are some examples:

~~~ruby
ins.set_irange(:smart)
ins.set_irange(ua: 2)
ins.set_irange(2.uA) # Same as above
ins.set_irange(ma: 200)
ins.set_irange(0.2) # Same as above
ins.set_irange(a: 0.2) # Same as above
~~~

A useful pattern when using this method is just to set the range to the test upper
spec limit, Origen will then take care of rounding this to the correct range.

See the
[J750 TestInstance API](http://origen-sdk.org/testers/api/OrigenTesters/IGXLBasedTester/J750/TestInstance.html)
for details on the currently available helper methods.

If you have a good helper method in your application that you think would be a
useful addition to Origen please do create a pull request with the additions to the
[Origen Testers plugin](https://github.com/Origen-SDK/origen_testers).

#### Avoiding Duplicate Test Instances

Your interface does not need to keep track of duplicate instances, Origen will automatically
get rid of them.
See the discussion "Avoiding Duplicate Tests" in the
[Creating an Interface](<%= path "guides/program/interface" %>) guide.

#### A Note on Test Instance Groups

IG-XL has the concept of a test instance group, that is a group of test instances that
you can call from a single line in the test flow. However the syntax for this in the test instance
sheet does not lend itself to easy generation - 
that is a test instance with the same name as an existing one will be treated as a group if
they occur next to each other, whereas it will be a validation error if they are apart.
This poses some problems for Origen when it comes to test instance generation - how does it
know when the instance your application has requested is a duplicate that should be screened
vs. an intentional generation of a group?

To avoid pushing responsibility of duplicate tracking to the application there is a dedicated
method for generating groups. Any instances generated within the given block of code will
be treated as a group:

~~~ruby
test_instances.group("vreg_func_all") do |group|
  $dut.vregs.each_with_index do |vreg, i|
    test_instances.functional("vreg_func")
  end
end
~~~

See the [group method API](http://origen-sdk.org/testers/api/OrigenTesters/IGXLBasedTester/Base/TestInstances.html#group-instance_method)
for more details and examples.

#### Structuring Your Instance Methods

As mentioned at the start the vast majority of your J750 interface code will be concerned
with generating test instances, so it pays to spend a bit of time up front thinking about
how to organize this code into a maintainable architecture.

The following techniques have proved to be useful in organizing the test instance generation
for some very large and complex test flows.

##### Create Base Instances

Add methods to create base test instances, that is
test instances which contains all of the attributes that every instance in your
application will have.

~~~ruby
def base_instance(name, type, options={})
  ins = test_instances.add(name, type)
  ins.dc_category = "VREG"
  if options[:vdd]
    ins.dc_selector = options[:vdd].to_s.capitalize  # If :min, :max for example
  else
    ins.dc_selector = "Typ"
  end
  ins.ac_category = "Spec"
  ins.ac_selector = "Default"
  ins.time_sets = "Tim"
  ins.pin_levels = "Lvl"
  ins    # Remember to return the newly created instance object to the caller
end

def func(name, options={})
  ins = base_instance(name, :functional, options)
  # Additional functional specific configuration here
end
~~~

This pattern can be extended to provide additional methods like "base_functional_instance", 
"base_bpmu_instance" and so on.

##### Use Decorator Methods

A decorator method is a method that decorates (or adds to) a test instance with specific
functionality.
For example in the flagship Origen application, some of our functional test instances required match
loop support while others did not, so we created a decorator that we could call to add
this feature:

~~~ruby
def add_match(ins)
  ins.post_test_f = "MatchBinFails"
  ins.pat_flag_f = "MatchLoopPatFlagFunc"
  ins.set_wait_flags :a
end

def func(name, options={})
  ins = base_instance(name, :functional, options)
  ins.add_match(ins) if some_logic_to_gate_this
end
~~~

##### Split Your Application Instances into Logical Groups

In the flagship application we found it best to conceptually split our test instance
generators by application-specific types rather than by sticking to the IG-XL types
like functional, BPMU, PPMU, etc.

It is hard to give a universal example here since this area is so application specific,
but to hopefully give you some food for thought...

In the flagship application we had a lot of parametric tests and initially we went down the
path of having an instance generation method for all BPMU tests and one for all PPMU tests.
However within those groups some of the tests were very different and it led to a
lot of complexity within those methods.

When we took a step back and looked at our application our tests were not really split into
2 types, rather they were comprised of 4 types - a high-voltage measurement, a high-voltage
calibration, a low-voltage measurement and a low-voltage calibration.
When we continued this process through our test flow as a whole we ended up with 14 different
test classifications and we then added a method dedicated to generating the test instance
for each one.

You should probably not go down this path initially, but once you get a feel for the
generation process and if your interface is starting to get complex, then this is a step
to consider.

### Creating a Pattern Entry

The hard part is over, creating pattern sets and groups is trivial by comparison to
creating test instances.
A similar API is provided to generate pattern resources in your test program and a nice
by product is that Origen will keep track of the referenced patterns and will produce a required
list of patterns at the end (which you can then pass to the pattern generator).

As with test instance generation Origen will deal with the suppression of duplicates in all
cases.

To add a pattern set call as follows:

~~~ruby
patsets.add("vreg_func_pset", pattern: "patterns/VREG/vreg_func.PAT")
~~~

Multiple patterns can be specified by passing an array as the 2nd argument:

~~~ruby
patsets.add("vreg_func_pset", [{pattern: "patterns/VREG/vreg_func.PAT"},
                               {pattern: "patterns/VREG/vreg_global_subs.PAT", start_label: "subr"}
                              ])
~~~

Creating pattern groups is identical, just substitute <code>patsets</code> with
<code>patgroups</code>.

Normally you would create a dedicated method for creating pattern sets to avoid
duplication, something like this:

~~~ruby
def add_patset(name)
  patsets.add("#{name}_pset", pattern: "patterns/VREG/#{name}.PAT")
end
~~~

The pattern set or group object can be assigned to the pattern attribute of a test
instance directly:

~~~ruby
def func(name, options={})
  ins = test_instances.functional(name)
  ins.pattern = add_patset(name)
end
~~~

If you just want to add a pattern reference outside of a pattern set or group then
add it to the <code>referenced_patterns</code> array to ensure that it gets added
to the list of required patterns that is output from the program generation process:

~~~ruby
referenced_patterns << "some_vreg_pattern"
~~~  

### Creating a Flow Entry

Within your interface the <code>flow</code> method will return an instance of
the J750 flow generator which provides methods for adding tests and other entries
to your test flow. See the [API](http://origen-sdk.org/testers/api/OrigenTesters/IGXLBasedTester/J750/Flow.html)
for full details.

So for example to enter a log print statement in the flow you can call:

~~~ruby
flow.logprint "Start of the vreg test section"
~~~

Going back to the earlier example from the [Creating Flows](<%= path "guides/program/flows" %>)
guide we had this in our flow:

~~~ruby
log "Vreg test module"
~~~

This is probably the simplest method to implement in our interface:

~~~ruby
def log(msg)
  flow.logprint(msg)
end
~~~

The most common call will be to the <code>test</code> method which will insert a call
to a test instance in the flow.
**Note that it is recommended that you pass all options from the test flow into any flow methods,
this ensures that any [flow control](<%= path "guides/program/flowapi" %>)
logic will get implemented**.

Here is a complete interface method for the first time that will generate a test instance,
add a pattern set reference to it, and now finally call the instance from the
test flow:

~~~ruby
def func(name, options={})
  ins = test_instances.functional(name)
  ins.pattern = add_patset(name)
  flow.test(ins, options)
end
~~~

The object returned from <code>flow.test</code> is an instance of
[OrigenTesters::IGXLBasedTester::J750::FlowLine](http://origen-sdk.org/testers/api/OrigenTesters/IGXLBasedTester/J750/FlowLine.html)
and this does provide a few methods that may be of use. However in general most of the
methods are there to support flow control and it is not recommended that you use these
directly, rather use the [flow control API](<%= path "guides/program/flowapi" %>) to
do this.

However it is recommended that you look at the
[TESTER_FLOWLINE_ATTRS](http://origen-sdk.org/testers/api/OrigenTesters/IGXLBasedTester/J750/FlowLine.html),
[ALIASES](http://origen-sdk.org/testers/api/OrigenTesters/IGXLBasedTester/Base/FlowLine.html),
and [DEFAULTS](http://origen-sdk.org/testers/api/OrigenTesters/IGXLBasedTester/Base/FlowLine.html)
definitions as this will tell you what the generator calls the IG-XL attributes. For example you can
see that the test number attribute is called <code>tnum</code> and that this is also aliased
to <code>'number'</code>.

This means that you can set this attribute via this style (which is most useful
for passing attributes through directly from the flow file):

~~~ruby
flow.test(ins, tnum: 10000)
~~~

Or it can also be set via a method call:

~~~ruby
flow_line = flow.test(ins)
flow_line.tnum = 10000
~~~

It is recommended that you create a dedicated method for flow insertion as this gives you
a single place to implement defaults and to perform any translation between what the flow has
called an attribute and what the J750 generator would call it:

~~~ruby
def add_flow_entry(ins, options)
  # Defaults
  options = {
    bin: 5,
    tname: options[:tname] || options[:name] || ins.name,
  }.merge(options)

  # Some translations
  options[:softbin] = options[:sbin] if options[:sbin]

  # Add the flow entry
  flow_line = flow.test(ins, options)

  # Some final decoration
  flow_line.continue_on_fail if options[:continue]

  flow_line
end
~~~

Here is an example interface method using this add to flow method:

~~~ruby
def func(name, options={})
  ins = test_instances.functional(name, options)
  ins.pattern = add_patset(name)
  add_flow_entry(ins, options)
end
~~~

Finally you may on occasion wish to call a test from your flow where the instance
is not available - maybe the instance is generated by another test module for example.
In this case the <code>:instance_not_available</code> option can be set to <code>true</code>
to prevent Origen from trying to match up the flow with an instance object.

~~~ruby
flow.test("POR_INSTANCE", instance_not_available: true)
~~~

### What About My DC Specs?

Other IG-XL sheets do not currently have generators available, although that is likely
to change in the future.

For now though the existing Origen-based applications have found that the other sheets tend
to be simple enough that they can be easily handled via a template-based approach.

To create a template simply build the sheet in IG-XL, export it to ASCII and this becomes
your initial template, then add Ruby snippets as required to make parts of it dynamic.

See the [Dynamic Custom Code](<%= path "guides/program/code" %>) guide for more details
on how to compile a template automatically during a program generation process.
