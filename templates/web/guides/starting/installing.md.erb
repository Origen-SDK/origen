Origen can be installed on Linux or Windows, this guide refers to the Linux installation.

If running on windows is of interest then please see this guide instead:
[How to Install Origen on Windows](<%= path "guides/starting/installwin" %>)

If you want to run on Linux Subsystem for Windows then please see this guide instead:
[How to Install Origen on Linux Subsystem for Windows](<%= path "guides/starting/installlsw" %>)

#### Background

Origen is distributed as a Ruby gem, which is the Ruby language's package manager.

Installation of Origen consists of the following steps:

* [Install Pre-Requisites](#Install_Pre-Requisites)
* [Install Ruby](#Install_Ruby)
* [Install Origen](#Install_Origen)
* [Customize your installation](<%= path "guides/starting/company" %>) (optional)

### 1. Install Pre-Requisites

To install Ruby, your system will need a C compiler and the Make utility. Installation of this
will vary depending on your particular Linux distribution, but for example on Ubuntu
the required build environment can be installed by running:

~~~text
sudo apt-get install build-essential
~~~

It is also recommend to install a recent version (2.x) of Git, if you don't know how to
do that, google for *"how to install Git on \<your distribution\>"*. 

### 2. Install Ruby

Origen requires a **minimum Ruby version of 2.1.0**, you can install this or the latest version.

If you are working from a personal Linux box (or VM), or if you want to install Ruby for
yourself only, we recommend that you install it via [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) and follow these
[installation instructions](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#installation).

This will install Ruby to your home directory and will not require you to have root access.

If you are working from a corporate environment where a central Ruby installation will
be used by many users, we recommend that you follow the instructions on the
[official Ruby installation guide](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

Most likely building from source will be the most appropriate choice in this case, especially
if dealing with an older Linux distribution, since the version available from your system's
package manager will probably be quite old.

If you have any particular problems installing Ruby, please [use this discussion thread](https://disqus.com/home/channel/origensdk/discussion/channel-origensdk/ruby_installation_issues/)
so that we can build up a record of common problems and solutions.

### 3. Modify Your $PATH

All Origen applications will create an `lbin` directory that contains the `origen` executable (and others), you should add these directories to your `$PATH`.

Executing this command will do that for bash:

~~~text
echo 'export PATH="./lbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
~~~

### 4. Install Origen

Once you have Ruby successfully installed, Origen can be installed very easily via:

~~~text
gem install origen --no-rdoc --no-ri
~~~

You can then verify Origen availability by running <code>origen -v</code>
at which point you should see something like this:

~~~text
    Origen: <%= Origen.version %>
~~~

Congratulations, Origen is now installed!

Note that the version of Origen that is installed to your Ruby installation does not need to
be kept up to date with the latest version of Origen. You can now consider your Ruby environment
to be frozen for the foreseeable future.

See the section on [Understanding Gems](<%= path "guides/starting/gems" %>) for details on
why that is.


#### A Note on Nokogiri

A common problem with the final step of installing Origen is to run into problems installing
a gem called Nokogiri (which is one of Origen's dependencies).

Generally the more recent your Linux distribution is, the less likely you are to have problems
with this.

It is beyond the scope of this document to deal with likely causes and solutions, however if
you do run into problems google should yield plenty of hits of similar cases and hopefully
with guidelines on how to fix it.

You can also report problems via this Origen forum thread on [Nokogiri Installation Issues](https://disqus.com/home/channel/origensdk/discussion/channel-origensdk/nokogiri_installation_issues/)
and we will do our best to provide help, or you can actually just comment below...
