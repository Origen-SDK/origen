Once you have installed Origen, you should
find that you now have access to an 'origen' executable from anywhere.

Run <code>origen</code> from the command line and you should see this:

~~~text
Usage: origen COMMAND [ARGS]

The following commands are available:
 new          Create a new Origen application or plugin. "origen new my_app" creates a
              new origen application workspace in "./my_app"
 interactive  Start an interactive Origen console (short-cut alias: "i"), this is just
              IRB with the 'origen' lib loaded automatically
 fetch        Automatically creates the workspace for the requested plugin and
              populates the latest version of the plugin (short-cut alias: "f")

Many commands can be run with -h (or --help) for more information.
~~~

Because you are currently outside of an Origen application, there is a reduced set
of commands available.

The <code>origen new</code> command should be used to generate a new application.

#### Running the New Application Command

To create a new application run the command like below and answer the questions
at the command prompt:

~~~text
origen new my_app_name
~~~

The new application will be custom built depending on your answers to the
questions and it should need no additional configuration to get started.

You can immediately start adding your application specific logic to the <code>lib</code>
directory.

#### Documenting Your Application

All new applications come with a pre-built framework for creating web-based
documentation of your application - just like the page that you are currently
reading.

To build the initial example documents:

~~~
origen web compile -a
~~~

Then just follow the instructions to point your browser to the address that
is output from the above command.
