Origen can be installed on Linux or Windows, this guide refers to the Windows installation.

The lack of a package manager in windows makes it harder to install various packages from the command line.  

We recommend using [chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org); an open source windows package manager.

You can imagine chocolatey to be somewhat like apt-get or other package managers on Linux, but built with Windows in mind.

This guide will use **chocolatey** as the package manager to:

* [Install Ruby](#Install_Ruby)
* [Install Ruby-Dependencies](#Install_Ruby-Dependencies)
   * [Install Ruby-Development-Kit](#Install_Ruby-Development-Kit) 
   * [Install RubyGems](#Install_RubyGems)
   * [Install RubyGems-SSL-workaround](#Install_RubyGems-SSL-workaround)
* [Install Utilities](#Install_Utilities)

#####**Note:** 

######Origen installation has been tested on Windows 7 only at this time, but we don’t think the installation process will be any different.

######*An active internet connection is required before proceeding.*

If running on Linux is of interest then please see this guide instead:
[How to Install Origen on Linux](<%= path "guides/starting/installing" %>)


#### Background

Origen is distributed as a Ruby gem, which is the Ruby language's package manager.

Installation of Origen consists of the following steps:

* [Install Ruby](#Install_Ruby)
* [Install Ruby-Dependencies](#Install_Ruby-Dependencies)
* [Install Origen](#Install_Origen)

### Install Chocolatey

All commands mentioned below need to be typed in the command prompt running as an administrator 

~~~text
Start → run → cmd runas /user:Administrator
~~~

* if the above command does not work, please follow the solution [here](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/run-a-command-as-administrator-from-the-windows-vista-run-box/)

##### 1. Chocolatey


To install the package manager (chocolatey), please type the text below in the command prompt (running as administrator)

~~~text
@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin
~~~

### Install Ruby

With the package manager installed, Installing Ruby is a breeze. Just type the following in the command prompt window (running as administrator)

~~~text
cinst ruby -y --force
~~~

This should install Ruby v2.1.6 (latest supported by the package manager as of writing this guide)

If the package manager upgrades to the latest version (v2.2.3), it will install that latest version instead.

Please check the ruby version and make a note of it. We will need it later for the RubyGems workaround.

~~~text
ruby -v
~~~

* You *might* need to close the command prompt and open a new one after installing Ruby for ruby -v to work.

Once the installer finishes, please close the current window and open a new one (as administrator)

### Install Ruby-Dependencies



- #### Install Ruby-Development-Kit

In the new window, type the following

~~~text
cinst ruby2.devkit -y --force
~~~

- #### Install RubyGems

In the same window, now type

~~~text
cinst rubygems -y --force
~~~

- #### Install RubyGems-SSL-workaround

The latest version of Rubygems (that we installed above) is currently broken on Windows.
However, there is a workaround that has been developed and it involves a series of steps.
The workaround also depends on which version of Ruby has been installed.

The following commands will perform all the steps required for the workaround.

If Ruby version installed is v2.1.X

~~~text
@powershell (new-object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/releases/download/v2.0.15/rubygems-update-2.0.15.gem','C:\rubygems-update-2.0.15.gem') && gem install --local C:\rubygems-update-2.0.15.gem && update_rubygems --no-ri --no-rdoc && gem uninstall rubygems-update -x
~~~


If Ruby version installed is v2.2.X

~~~text
@powershell (new-object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/releases/download/v2.2.3/rubygems-update-2.2.3.gem’,'C:\rubygems-update-2.2.3.gem') && gem install --local C:\rubygems-update-2.2.3.gem && update_rubygems --no-ri --no-rdoc && gem uninstall rubygems-update -x
~~~

Once the command finishes, please check the gem version installed by typing

~~~text
gem --version
~~~

The Gem version should be **v2.0.15** for Ruby v2.1.X or v2.2.3 for Ruby v2.2.X

Before attempting to install the Origen gem, please confirm that the DevKit has been installed successfully and that it has successfully detected the ruby installation.

Please follow the steps below:

~~~text
 - open C:\Tools\DevKit\config.yml in your favorite editor and type the path to your ruby installation directory 
   (see image below for example). 
~~~
   config.yml: ![config.yml](https://a.disquscdn.com/uploads/mediaembed/images/2542/9947/original.jpg)

~~~text
 - Open a command prompt window and type the following:
     - cd C:\Tools\DevKit\
     - ruby dk.rb install
~~~
   commands: ![type these commands](https://a.disquscdn.com/uploads/mediaembed/images/2542/9948/original.jpg)

### Install Origen

Origen is available as a packaged gem and can be easily installed by typing:

~~~text
gem install origen --no-ri --no-rdoc
~~~

######*this can take several minutes to finish without updating the screen, so please be patient

You can then verify Origen availability by running origen -v at which point you should see something like this:

~~~text
    Origen: <%= Origen.version %>
~~~

Congratulations, Origen is now installed!

Note that the version of Origen that is installed to your Ruby installation does not need to
be kept up to date with the latest version of Origen. You can now consider your Ruby environment
to be frozen for the foreseeable future.

See the section on [Understanding Gems](<%= path "guides/starting/gems" %>) for details on
why that is.


### Install Utilities

It is also recommend to install a recent version (2.x) of Git

We can do that easily now by typing

~~~text
cinst git -y
~~~

This will install Git v2.5.2 (latest version available as of writing this guide)

**Optional:**

We recommend that you also install the following utilities for a more UNIX like experience on windows.

 - UnxUtils (cinst unxutils -y)
 - ConsoleZ (cinst consoleZ -y)
 - Console2 (download from http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/)



### Video

For your convenience, you can also watch the installation process in the video below.
