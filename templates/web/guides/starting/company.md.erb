A mechanism is provided to customize the Origen installation to a particular
company.

The main customization options that this currently provides are:

* An internal gem server. This can be used to distribute private Origen plugins
  within your company. When this is defined any new Origen applications that are created
  will automatically come configured to read from your server in addition to rubygems.org.
* Integration with your company's email delivery system, allowing your applications to
  easily send transactional email to their users. 
* Integration with your company's LDAP user authentication system. This API may not be
  generic enough yet, but it is used within Freescale and we are keen to work
  with anyone who wants to pilot it within another company.

#### How The Configuration System Works

Whenever an application is invoked, one of the first things that Origen will do is search
for a company configuration file called <code>origen_site_config.yml</code>.

Starting from the application directory, the file system will be checked for the presence
of any valid configuration files within the application's root directory, and then in any of its parent
directories until it hits the file system root directory.

It will then check for a configuration file within the directory where Ruby is installed,
and then again recursively through any of its parent directories.

If multiple files are found then they will all be applied, with highest priority given
to the files that are found first - i.e. those located closest to the current application.
  
So for example, if everyone in your company uses a common Ruby installation, then you can put a config
file somewhere in Ruby's directory and it will be globally applied.

Alternatively, if all of your users have their workspaces underneath <code>/proj</code> or
similar, then <code>/proj/origen_site_config.yml</code> may be a good place to put it.
This also provides a mechanism for per-project or even per-application overrides by
adding additional config files higher up the tree.

#### Creating the Configuration File

To create a config file simple copy the [default configuration from Origen core](https://github.com/Origen-SDK/origen/blob/master/origen_site_config.yml)
and edit it as required.

The values present in this default file are the ones that will be applied by default in
an installation where no custom configs are present.

#### Testing the Configuration File

To test if your configuration values are being applied, open a console within an
Origen application:

~~~text
origen i
~~~

You can then query the current live values via the following API, where the method names
correspond directly to the attribute names in the config file:

~~~ruby
Origen.site_config.gem_server          # => nil
Origen.site_config.gem_manage_bundler  # => true
~~~

% end
