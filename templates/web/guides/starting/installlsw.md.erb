Origen can be installed on Linux, Windows or Windows Subsystem for Linux, this guide refers to the Windows Subsystem for Linux installation.

If you want to run on Linux Subsystem for Windows then please see this guide instead:
[How to Install Origen on Linux](<%= path "guides/starting/install" %>)

If running on windows is of interest then please see this guide instead:
[How to Install Origen on Windows](<%= path "guides/starting/installwin" %>)

#### Install Ubuntu

With Windows 10, Microsoft has allowed for a Linux Subsystem to be installed when you will need to change the security mode to 'Developer Mode'

1.  Start Menu -> Settings -> Update and Security
2.  Select *_For developers_* on the left menu
3.  Under 'Use developer features', select 'Developer Mode'

Now we will enable enable the 'Linux Subsystem for Windows'

1.  Open up Control Panel
2.  Go to Programs
3.  Select 'Turn Windows features on or off'
4.  Select 'Windows Subsystem for Linux'
5.  Press OK
6.  Follow prompts and you might have to reboot.

When this finishes, you will now be able to load a Linux distribution from the Windows Store.  For this guide, we will install the Ubuntu version of Linux.

1.  Open up the Microsoft Store
2.  Search for 'Linux' and select 'Apps'
3.  Choose 'Ubuntu'
4.  Follow prompts and install Ubuntu
5.  It will ask for a username and password.  This will be the System Adminsitrator account.  When you run 'sudo' commands, it will ask for this password.

This version of Ubuntu might be out of date.  To get things up-to-date, you will need to update Ubuntu.  To do this, run the following command:
~~~
sudo apt-get update
~~~
This will update Ubuntu and all of the packages to the latest.  At this point, if you do not want any graphical user interfaces, you can go to [Install Pre-Requisites](<%= path "guides/starting/install/#Install_Pre-Requisites" %>) for 'Installing Origen on Linux'

#### Setting the PATH
The following PATH changes will need to be updated:
~~~
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$HOME/.rbenv/shims:$PATH"
~~~
This will allow the Ruby Environment to run.

#### Graphical User Interface
The Windows Subsystem for Linux is only command line base.  If you would like to have Graphical Support, you will need to add an X Server.
