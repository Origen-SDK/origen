All environments are defined by files that reside in the <code>environment</code> directory.
Environments are regular Ruby files and they should be simply named:

~~~text
<identifier>.rb
~~~

In a test engineering application where the environment is used to select the target test platform,
they are normally named after the tester, e.g.

~~~text
environment
|-- j750.rb
|-- uflex.rb
|-- v93k.rb
`-- jlink.rb
~~~

#### Creating an Environment

To create a new environment, simply create the file containing whatever Ruby code you need.
They are usually very concise and in a test engineering application would normally only instantiate the
target tester driver, here are some examples:

~~~ruby
# environment/j750.rb
$tester = OrigenTesters::J750.new

# environment/v93k.rb
$tester = OrigenTesters::V93K.new

# environment/jlink.rb
$tester = OrigenDebuggers::JLink.new
~~~

If the given driver supports configuration options, then you may have some variations
for a given platform - e.g. <code>j750_probe.rb</code> to configure the driver slightly differently
for generating probe test patterns:

~~~ruby
# environment/j750_probe.rb
$tester = OrigenTesters::J750.new
$tester.available_power_supplies = 64
~~~

#### Setting a Default Environment

A default environment can be defined that will be used withing a new workspace unless the user
specifies otherwise. This is not required and should only be added if it makes sense within the
context of the application - i.e. you may choose not to have a default to avoid the situation where the user
builds something without really understanding what configuration they are targeting.

A default is specified by creating an environment file called <code>environment/default.rb</code>,
typically this is a symbolic link to another environment file:

~~~text
ln -s environment/j750.rb environment/default.rb
~~~

#### Getting and Setting the Environment

The current environment for a given application workspace can be queried by running the
<code>origen environment</code> command, or <code>origen e</code> for short, this will show
you the content of the current environment file:

~~~text
> origen e

Current environment: j750.rb
**********************************************************************
  $tester = OrigenTesters::J750.new
**********************************************************************
~~~

The environment can be changed by running the same command and supplying the desired environment:

~~~text
> origen e environment/j750.rb

> origen e v93k
~~~

As shown above, a full path or any snippet which is enough to uniquely identify one of the available
environment files is sufficient.

Additionally all Origen commands allow an override to be supplied at runtime:

~~~text
> origen g my_pattern -e jlink
~~~

% end
