Typically an Origen application will contain source code to generate IP that can be
applied to many different products, and/or which can run on many different test platforms.
It is the job of the *target* and the *environment* to setup the runtime conditions that will
define what combination of product and tester platform will be targeted by the
generated output.

The target is normally used to define the product side of the runtime environment, with one
target file existing for every product/device that the application supports.
Target files are usually very short and normally just instantiate the model of the target
device, assigning it to the global variable <code>$dut</code>.

For test engineering applications, the test platform selection is usually handled by environment
files. These are very similar to target files and there is usually one per supported test
platform. Each environment will typically instantiate the target tester model/driver, assigning it
to the global variable <code>$tester</code>.
For non-test engineering applications, the environment layer can either be omitted or
else it can be used to define whatever other global state makes sense to be applied across
multiple device targets.

Additionally, Origen has the concept of an operating mode and this can be considered a
third component of the runtime environment.

These three components have the following priority in ascending order:

* Mode
* Environment
* Target

This means that the active environment can override the active mode, and that the active target can
override both the mode and the environment.

#### How the Runtime Environment is Applied

Before compiling any template, or generating any pattern, test program or other source file,
Origen will do the following:

* Apply the active mode
* Execute the active environment file
* Execute the active target file

This sequence will be repeated between jobs (each source files is an individual job) if multiple
files are being compiled/generated by a given Origen thread of execution. This guarantees that the
output is not affected by generation order, since every individual job
is always executed against a fresh set of runtime models/drivers which prevents their state from a previous
job from carrying over to the next.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  This sequence of reloading the mode, environment and target is generally referred to as 
  "reloading the target".
  No API exists within Origen to reload only one of these component, so anytime you see a reference
  to the target being re-loaded it means that all three of the runtime environment components will be
  refreshed.
