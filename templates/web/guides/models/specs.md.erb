[Dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/specification?s=t) defines a specifications (or spec):

*a detailed description or assessment of requirements, dimensions, materials, etc., as of proposed building, machine, bridge, etc.*

Origen refines spec to mean a parametric measure that has the following basic attributes:

* Name
* Symbol
* Type
* Mode
* Audience
* Description
* Limits (min, max, typ)

This is not the complete list of attributes but a well defined spec should define these
attributes.

#### Specification API

**The spec API is in the preliminary stages so please send feedback for enhancements**

Most engineers are probably familiar with a data sheet specification that looks something
like this:

|  Parameter      |    Symbol    |   Min   |   Typ   |   Max   |  Unit  |  Notes    |
|:----------------|:-------------|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:------:|:----------|
| ADDR/CMD Setup  | tddkhas      | 495     |         |         | ps     | wrt MCK   |

There are three attributes required to define a Spec: name, mode, and type.  A fourth
attribute (sub_type) can further delineate a Spec but it is not required.  The basic
spec API can take two syntactical forms.  The first is a more traditional Ruby syntax
and the second makes the API feel more like a custom DSL.

~~~ruby
spec :soc_vdd, :dc do |spec|
  spec.symbol = "Vdd"
  spec.description = "Soc Core Power Supply"
  spec.min = "1.00.V - 50.mV"
  spec.max = 1.05
  spec.unit = "V"
  spec.audience = :external
end
~~~

~~~ruby
spec :soc_vdd, :dc do
  symbol "Vdd"
  description "Soc Core Power Supply"
  min "1.00.V - 50.mV"
  max 1.05
  unit "V"
  audience :external
end
~~~

While the user can be free to add various attributes over time, they must assign a valid
name and have valid limits to complete instantiation.  **A valid name must not start with
letters and cannot contain special characters forbidden by Ruby.**  Dashes and underscores
are allowed but the preferred method is to make spec name Symbols in the [snake-case format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case).
Limits can be of type Numeric or String so the API is flexible enough to handle
specs with a formula as the limit.  Valid limits are defined as:

* If Min && Max: Min < Max if limit is Numeric.

* If Target, Min < Target < Max

A target can be thought of as an unofficial typical value.  Targets are typically used when
specs are exported for use in data analysis and also help understand if a min anx max limit
are not symetrical.

During spec limit assignment the user just can either input a numeric value, a symbol or
a string.

~~~ruby
[1] pry()> @ip.specs(:ip_setup_time).min
=> #<struct Origen::Specs::Spec::Limit exp="250.ps + 25.ps", maturity=nil, value=2.7e-10>
[2] pry()> @ip.specs(:ip_setup_time).min.exp
=> "250.ps + 25.ps"
[3] pry()> @ip.specs(:ip_setup_time).min.value
=> 2.7e-10
~~~

The Spec model will save the original user input as an expression and will
attempt to evaluate the string to a numeric value or lookup the symbol within the
Parameters and Specs database.  Currently only the numeric and string expressions are working.

Notice how the mode attribute is never specified.  This is because the Spec API will
always use the mode of the current object as a default.  If no mode is specified (nil)
the user intends for the Spec to be available to all modes of the defining object.  The
user, of course, can specify a mode as shown below.  The Spec API will only return
specs that match that specified mode instead of returning globally defined specs.

~~~ruby
spec :soc_vdd, :dc, :mymode do
  symbol "Vdd"
  description "Soc Core Power Supply"
  min "1.00.V - 50.mV"
  max 1.05
  unit "V"
  audience :external
end
~~~

Another thing to note about modes is that specs defined with no mode will be
catalogued as :global if the owning object is Origen.top_level and :local for
any other owning IP.  This allows certain specs to be used across the Origen
ecosystem and other local specs to be contained inside the owning IP.

The user can search for specs using filters for any of the following:

1. Name
2. Mode
3. Type
4. Sub-Type

If any of the options are nil it will not filter by that option when interrogating the
spec database.  The API is:

~~~ruby
specs(:myspecname, options)
~~~

In the example above a symbol is passed for the spec name but all four filter options
can be a String, Number or a Regexp.  If an object defined three specs named :soc_vdd,
:io_vdd, :pll_vdd the following call would occur.

~~~ruby
specs(/vdd/,verbose: true)
~~~

~~~text
================================================================================================
| IP: soc                                                                                      |
================================================================================================
| Name    | Symbol | Mode    | Type | Parameter             | Min     | Max  | Unit | Audience |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| soc_vdd | Vdd    | :global | dc   | Soc Core Power Supply | 0.95    | 1.05 | V    | external |
| io_vdd  | OVdd   | :global | dc   | Soc IO Power Supply   | 1.45    | 1.55 | V    | external |
| pll_vdd | AVdd   | :global | dc   | Soc PLL Power Supply  | 1.15    | 1.25 | V    | external |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~~~

If the 'verbose' argument is not included, only an array of spec objects is returned.  If only a
single spec is found a Spec object is returned instead of an array of a single spec.  The console
printing method only displays attributes which have content for at least one of the specs
found.  It also auto-adjusts the attribute column padding so no space is wasted.

#### Specs and Modes in Detail

Specs can be defined globally or within nested [sub_blocks](http://origen-sdk.org/origen/api/Origen/SubBlock.html)
 or [controllers](http://origen-sdk.org/origen/api/Origen/Controller.html).  A spec
is defined in the context of a mode, even if it only has a single mode.  A mode is defined as
a known device state with a unique name or id.  An simple example could be a basic PORESET
that defines the clocking and register space state after turning a chip on.  The spec
API does not require a mode to be defined but it will assign some reserved modes if none is
provided.

If the owner of the block is equal to Origen.top_level a mode named :global is assigned,
otherwise a mode named :local is assigned.  Specs with a local mode are not accessible
outside the model in which they are defined.  A spec with a global mode is accessible
everywhere but will be overwritten is defined both globally and locally.  Here is an
example where a spec is defined within three modes.

~~~ruby
class SoC_With_Specs
  include Origen::TopLevel

  def initialize
    sub_block :ip_with_specs, class_name: "IP_With_Specs", base_address: 0x1000_0000
    add_mode :default
    add_mode :low_power
    add_mode :high_performance

    modes.each do |mode|
      case mode
      when :default
        vdd_nom = 1.0.V
      when :low_power
        vdd_nom = 0.95.V
      when :high_performance
        vdd_nom = 1.05.V
      end
      spec :soc_vdd, :dc, mode do
        symbol "Vdd"
        description "Soc Core Power Supply"
        min "#{vdd_nom} - 50.mV"
        max "#{vdd_nom} + 50.mV"
        audience :external
      end
    end
  end
end
~~~

Notice below how both the limit expression and value get changed based on the mode
selection of the owning IP.

~~~text
[8] pry()> @dut.mode
=> high_performance
[9] pry()> @dut.specs(:soc_vdd).min.exp
=> "1.05 - 50.mV"
[10] pry()> @dut.specs(:soc_vdd).min.value
=> 1.0
[11] pry()> @dut.mode = :low_power
=> :low_power
[12] pry()> @dut.specs(:soc_vdd).min.value
=> 0.9
[13] pry()> @dut.specs(:soc_vdd).min.exp
=> "0.95 - 50.mV"
~~~

Specs have an audience attribute that can be set to :internal or :external.  They
also have a read-only attribute called 'limit_type' which is either :single_sided
or :double_sided.  Here are some attribute access examples:

~~~text
[7] pry()> @ip.specs(:ip_setup_time).mode
=> :new_mode_with_altered_specs
[8] pry()> @ip.specs(:ip_setup_time).limit_type
=> :double_sided
[10] pry()> @ip.specs(:ip_setup_time).notes = "my note"
=> "my note"
[11] pry()> @ip.specs(:ip_setup_time).notes
=> "my note"
[12] pry()> @ip.specs(:ip_setup_time).symbol # Defaults to name if no value supplied
=> :ip_setup_time
[13] pry()> @ip.specs(:ip_setup_time).testable
=> true
[14] pry()> @ip.specs(:ip_setup_time).audience
=> :internal
[15] pry()> @ip.specs(:ip_setup_time).description
=> "IP Setup Time with Double-Sided Limits"
~~~

The Origen::Specs::Spec class is available to all models and as such has a method ot find all specs
that exist in the model itself or any child models.  This method is useful when trying to
export the spec information of a model to other API.

~~~ruby
[2] pry(#<RSpec::ExampleGroups::OrigenSpecsModule>)> @dut.find_specs.size
=> 8
~~~

#### Remaining Issues and Documentation

* Add in support for spec 'notes' being more than just a text string.
  Will require adding in a Note class to Origen.

* Add in support for Specs and Parameters lookup for formula evaluation.

* Enable more attributes required for traceability and test plan creation

* Formalize a spec guardband definition and methodology

* Enable Spec name lookup for symbols used in limit formulas
