Origen is an object-oriented environment and we have already seen that the application
domain will be modelled by creating object instances which represent the physical silicon.
However the real power of object-oriented programming comes when we start assigning attributes
to our objects.

#### Static Attributes

Continuing our example of modelling a fictional NVM module, an obvious attribute to start with is the
size of our NVM memory blocks, we can add this attribute like this:

~~~ruby
# lib/nvm/memory_128_b954.rb
module NVM
  class MEMORY_128_B954
    include Origen::Model

    def initialize(options={})
      @size_in_kb = 128
    end
  end
end
~~~

<code>@size_in_kb</code> is an example of an instance variable in Ruby. An instance variable
is one where the value it contains is unique to each object instance, so for example if we have multiple
instances of the same class then we can update the value held by an instance variable in one of them without
affecting the value held by the same variable in the other instances.

Instances variables are globally available within a class definition, in other words you can make
a reference to <code>@size_in_kb</code> from any methods that are defined within that class. However to
access them externally we need to create a getter method:

~~~ruby
# lib/nvm/memory_128_b954.rb
module NVM
  class MEMORY_128_B954
    include Origen::Model

    def initialize(options={})
      @size_in_kb = 128
    end

    def size_in_kb
      @size_in_kb
    end
  end
end
~~~

In Ruby a method implicitly returns the value of the last piece of code it executed, so the method we
just added will return the value held by <code>@size_in_kb</code>.
We can now ask a memory block it's size:

~~~ruby
$dut = SOC::EAGLE_M352.new

$dut.nvm.memories.first.size_in_kb     # => 128
~~~  

Note that we have used a method named <code>first</code> above but we have not defined that anywhere.
The <code>memorys</code> method created by Origen (which we aliased as <code>memories</code>
returns the associated sub-blocks within a Ruby array. In Ruby everything
is an object, so an array is a built-in object that comes complete with it's own set of useful methods
that we can leverage.
Ruby is very well documented, here is the page describing all of the methods available to an Array:
[Ruby Array](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html).

Because the above example of creating a getter method is so common, Ruby provides a shorthand. We can re-write
the above example as:

~~~ruby
# lib/nvm/memory_128_b954.rb
module NVM
  class MEMORY_128_B954
    include Origen::Model

    attr_reader :size_in_kb
    
    def initialize(options={})
      @size_in_kb = 128
    end
  end
end
~~~

This creates a reader (or getter) method which will look for an instance variable of the same name and
return it. If the variable of the same name doesn't exist then it will return <code>nil</code>.

#### Calculated Attributes

Attributes can also be derived from functions.

For example within our application it may be useful to consume the size attribute in various formats,
let's create a method to return the size in bytes:

~~~ruby
# lib/nvm/memory_128_b954.rb
module NVM
  class MEMORY_128_B954
    include Origen::Model

    attr_reader :size_in_kb
    
    def initialize(options={})
      @size_in_kb = 128
    end

    def size_in_bytes
      @size_in_kb * 1024
    end
  end
end
~~~

Of course such functions can also incorporate multiple attributes, here we create a method to return
the size in longwords:

~~~ruby
# lib/nvm/memory_128_b954.rb
module NVM
  class MEMORY_128_B954
    include Origen::Model

    attr_reader :size_in_kb, :longword_size_in_bytes
    
    def initialize(options={})
      @size_in_kb = 128
      @longword_size_in_bytes = 8
    end

    def size_in_bytes
      @size_in_kb * 1024
    end

    def size_in_longwords
      size_in_bytes / longword_size_in_bytes
    end
  end
end
~~~

Note that sometimes you will see attribute or method references using the keyword <code>self</code>
which means "the current instance". Our size_in_longwords method could be re-written as:

~~~ruby
def size_in_longwords
  self.size_in_bytes / self.longword_size_in_bytes
end
~~~

Whether or not to use the self notation is really a matter of personal preference but be aware
of it as you may see it used in other code whether or not you use it yourself.

Another point to note is that the method was not written like this:

~~~ruby
def size_in_longwords
  @size_in_bytes / @longword_size_in_bytes
end
~~~

While this would have worked equally well, it is generally bad practice to reference instance variables
directly and instead it is preferable to access them through a reader method, even when referencing
them internally.

The reason for this is that if you ever need to transform or filter the value of an attribute, it can
be done easily in a single place if all references to the variable are made through a reader method.

#### Dynamic Attributes

Some attributes will change value during the course of executing your application, therefore in such
cases we need a way of setting the value of the attribute in addition to reading it. 

Sticking with our NVM memory model such an attribute might be the value held by certain addresses in
the flash memory. Let's create a new attribute to represent the data held by a location which we
will call <code>config</code>.

~~~ruby
# lib/nvm/memory_128_b954.rb
module NVM
  class MEMORY_128_B954
    include Origen::Model

    def initialize(options={})
      @config_data = 0xFF
    end

    def config_data
      @config_data
    end

    def config_data=(value)
      @config_data = value
    end
  end
end
~~~

With our new getter and setter methods for the <code>config_data</code> attribute we can now change
the value of it dynamically:

~~~ruby
$dut = SOC::EAGLE_M352.new

mem = $dut.nvm.memories.first

mem.config_data          # => 0xFF
mem.config_data = 5
mem.config_data          # => 5
~~~  

Again this is such a common pattern that a shorthand exists, to create getter and setter methods equivalent to
those above we can do:

~~~ruby
# lib/nvm/memory_128_b954.rb
module NVM
  class MEMORY_128_B954
    include Origen::Model

    attr_reader :config_data
    attr_writer :config_data
  end
end
~~~

Or to create both, a further shorthand exists:

~~~ruby
# lib/nvm/memory_128_b954.rb
module NVM
  class MEMORY_128_B954
    include Origen::Model

    attr_accessor :config_data

  end
end
~~~

#### Anonymous Sub-blocks with Attributes

Sub-blocks without a specific class definition also support attributes, any attributes can either be
directly written to the sub-block or supplied in the sub-block definition:

~~~ruby
class MySoC
  include Origen::TopLevel

  def initialize(options={})
    sub_block :ram, size_in_kb: 128

    # Once defined any additional attributes can be declared on the fly
    ram.clk_domain = :ipg
  end
end

$dut = MySoC.new

$dut.ram.size_in_kb        # => 128
$dut.ram.clk_domain        # => :ipg
$dut.ram.vendor = "Mentor"
$dut.ram.vendor            # "Mentor"
~~~

% end
