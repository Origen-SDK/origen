Origen provides a pin (and pin group) API that should be used to define and manipulate the
physical pins of the device.

Pins are mainly intended to be defined on models that will be used for pattern generation
and where the pins represent the physical device pins that the tester can interact with.
However in its basic form a pin is just an object that can hold a data state and there
are probably some creative uses of the pin models outside of pattern generation.

The pin API is made available to your model by including the
<code>Origen::TopLevel</code> or <code>Origen::Model</code> modules.

While pins can be added
from any sub-module the ownership of all pins is always assigned to the top-level object,
this is reflecting real life where the pin is a physical property of the top-level SoC.
Therefore it is recommended that pin definitions are always made on the top-level object
and most modern Origen applications now take this approach.

#### Defining Pins

Pins should be defined as part of the object initialization process, but to avoid the
initialize method growing out of hand it is recommended that pins are instantiated in a
dedicated method that is called upon initialization.

Here is an example of how to define some JTAG interface pins in an SoC model:

~~~ruby
class MySoC
  include Origen::TopLevel

  def initialize(options={})
    instantiate_pins(options)
  end

  def instantiate_pins(options={})
    add_pin :tclk, reset: :drive_hi, meta: { max_freq: 15.Mhz }
    add_pin :tdi, direction: :input
    add_pin :tdo, direction: :output
    add_pin :tms
  end
end
~~~

Some points to note in the above code:

* <code>add_pin</code> will instantiate an instance of [Origen::Pins::Pin](<%= path "/api/Origen/Pins/Pin.html" %>)
* Each pin must be given a name, or handle, similar to how registers are named. However unlike
  registers **the name must not only be unique within the parent object but it must also be unique
  within the scope of all objects instantiated by a target**. The easiest way to comply with this requirement
  is to follow the advice of handling all pin definitions at the top level.
* Pins are initialized in the don't care state by default, an alternative default state can be specified via
  the <code>:reset</code> option.
* Pins are I/Os by default, however they can be defined as input or output only by using the <code>:direction</code>
  option.
* Application-specific meta data can be attached to the given pin via the <code>:meta</code> option  

Pins are accessed via the <code>pin</code> method:

~~~ruby
$dut.pin(:tdi)     # => <pin object>
~~~

Note that pins can be accessed locally from any object that includes the <code>Origen::Model</code> module:

~~~ruby
$dut.pin(:tdi) == $dut.memories.rambist.pin(:tdi)   # => true
~~~

However references to pins within a sub-block would typically use an alias that reflected the pin function related to
that sub-block.

Pin aliases are added like this:

~~~ruby
has_pin?(:tdi)               # => true
has_pin?(:bisti)             # => false

add_pin_alias :bisti, :tdi

has_pin?(:bisti)             # => true
pin(:bisti) == pin(:tdi)     # => true
~~~

Or called directly on the pin:

~~~ruby
pin(:tdi).add_alias(:bisti)
~~~

#### Defining Pin Groups

Pin groups are modelled by an object called a [PinCollection](<%= path "/api/Origen/Pins/PinCollection.html" %>)
which is very similar in principle to the BitCollection used for modelling registers.
A [PinCollection](<%= path "/api/Origen/Pins/PinCollection.html" %>) is essentially an extension of a regular Ruby
array object which has some of its own attributes (such as an id for example) and everything else is proxied to
the contained pin objects.

For pattern generation pins and pin groups will support the same API so that application code does not have to
give much concern as to whether it is dealing with one or the other.

Pin groups are defined in a similar manner to single pins:

~~~ruby
add_pins :porta, size: 32
add_pins :portb, size: 16, endian: :little
~~~

Some points to note in the above code:

* <code>add_pins</code> will generate a new pin group, e.g. named <code>:porta</code> and individual pin
  objects named <code>:porta0</code> through <code>:porta31</code>.
  See below for how to define pin groups based on existing pins.
* Pin groups can be any size, define via the <code>:size</code> option.
* Pin groups are big endian by default, however little endian can be specified via the
  <code>:endian</code> option. Changing this attribute will have the effect of reversing the
  order that data is applied in a test pattern.
  
Pin groups can be looked up like regular pins, or via a dedicated method if it makes application code clearer:

~~~ruby
pins(:porta)               # => <pin collection>
pin_group(:porta)          # => <pin collection>
~~~

A pin group is a regular Ruby array and can be iterated on and so on:

~~~ruby
pins(:porta).size          # => 32

pins(:porta).each do |pin|
  # Do this for pin :porta0, :porta1, etc.
end
~~~

Within a pin group individual pins can be addressed via a local index:

~~~ruby
pins(:porta)[0] == pins(:porta0)   # => true
~~~

Anonymous pin groups can be composed from a range of indexes at runtime:

~~~ruby
pins(:porta).data                 # => 0x0000_0000
pins(:porta)[0,1,2,3].drive(0xF)
pins(:porta).data                 # => 0x0000_000F
pins(:porta)[8..15].drive(0x55)
pins(:porta).data                 # => 0x0000_550F  
~~~

Pin groups can be composed from any arbitrary group of existing pins using the <code>add_pin_group</code> method:

~~~ruby
# The first argument is the ID for the new pin group, followed by the IDs of the pins it should contain
add_pin_group :jtag, :tdi, :tdo, :tclk, :tms

pins(:jtag).size   # => 4
~~~

Pin groups can be aliased in the same way as pins, for readability the method <code>add_pin_group_alias</code>
can be used, although internally it is the same as <code>add_pin_alias</code>:

~~~ruby
add_pin_group_alias :porta, :data

pin_group(:data).dont_care  # Can now be used as if it were a regular first class pin group
~~~

It is possible to alias a single pin within a pin group, in that case a pin number argument
must be supplied to <code>add_pin_alias</code>:

~~~ruby
add_pin_alias :moda, :porta, pin: 4
~~~

It is also possible to create a pin group from a subset of pins of a regular pin group, simply
pass in a range or an array of pin indexes to <code>add_pin_group_alias</code>:

~~~ruby
add_pin_group_alias :data_byte_0, :porta, pins: [7..0]
add_pin_group_alias :data_byte_1, :porta, pins: [8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]

pins(:data_byte_0).dont_care  # Can now be used as if it were a regular first class pin group
~~~

#### Power and Ground Pin Modelling

The API supports modelling power and ground pins as follows:

~~~ruby
add_pin :pinx

add_power_pin :vdd1
add_power_pin :vdd2

add_ground_pin :gnd1
add_ground_pin :gnd2
add_ground_pin :gnd3

add_power_pin_group :vdd, :vdd1, :vdd2

add_ground_pin_group :gnd, :gnd1, :gnd2, :gnd3
~~~

This will cause these pins to be stored in separate collections to make pattern and other content generation easier:

~~~ruby
# Based on the above example
pins.size           # => 1
power_pins.size     # => 2
ground_pins.size    # => 3
~~~

Power and ground pin lookup should be done via dedicated methods:

~~~ruby
power_pin(:vdd1)
ground_pins(:gnd)

ground_pin_groups.each do |id, group|
  # Do this for each ground pin group
end
~~~

Power pins have some dedicated attributes that can be defined, in additional to the generic meta-data hash supported
by all pins:

~~~ruby
add_power_pin :vddio, voltage: 3, current_limit: 50.mA, meta: { min_voltage: 1.5 }

power_pin(:vddio).voltage             # => 3
power_pin(:vddio).current_limit       # => 50E-03
power_pin(:vddio).meta[:min_voltage]  # => 1.5
~~~
  
#### Virtual Pin Modelling

The API supports modelling virtual pins.  Virtual pins are essentially user-defined pins that may not necessarily be
associated with the SoC, such as:

*  Tester utility pins that control relay states on the device interface board (DIB)
*  Tester channels to control components on the DIB

~~~ruby
add_virtual_pin(:virtual1, type: :utility_pin)
add_virtual_pin(:virtual2, type: :utility_pin)
add_virtual_pin(:virtual3, type: :relay_pin)

add_virtual_pin_group :utility, :virtual1, :virtual2
add_virtual_pin_group :relay, :virtual3
~~~

This will cause these pins to be stored in separate collections to make content generation easier:

~~~ruby
# Based on the above example
virtual_pins.size           # => 3
~~~

Virtual pin lookup should be done via a dedicated method:

~~~ruby
virtual_pin(:virtual1)

virtual_pin_groups.each do |id, group|
  # Do this for each virtual pin group
end
~~~
  
#### Changing Data State

See the [Pin API](<%= path "/api/Origen/Pins/Pin.html" %>)
for full details of what methods are available. 

Here are a few examples of working with pins:

~~~ruby
# Make the tester drive a value on a pin
pin(:tdi).drive_hi

# Equivalent to above, this form is better when serially applying data in a loop...
pin(:tdi).drive(1)  
# ...like this...
reg(:data).shift_out_left do |bit|
  pin(:porta).drive(bit.data)
end

# Asserting that a pin drives a certain value has various aliases, these are all equivalent
pin(:tdo).assert(1)
pin(:tdo).compare(1)
pin(:tdo).expect(1)

# Current state can be queried
pin(:tdo).driving?    # false
pin(:tdo).comparing?  # true
pin(:tdo).dont_care
pin(:tdo).comparing?  # false

pin(:tms).drive_lo
pin(:tms).toggle

# Pin groups support the same methods as pins
pins(:porta).drive(0x55)   # 01010101
pins(:porta).assert(0x55)  # LHLHLHLH
pins(:porta).dont_care     # XXXXXXXX

# Individual pins within a pin group can be accessed by index
pins(:porta)[1].drive(0)   # XXXXXX0X
~~~

#### Bang (!) Methods

Almost all pin methods have a bang form, for example:

~~~ ruby
pin(:tdi).drive!(1)
~~~

The bang methods will set the state on the pin in the same way as the regular method but
will then automatically fire off a tester cycle to generate a vector.

In other words the above is the shorthand equivalent of:

~~~ ruby
pin(:tdi).drive(1)
$tester.cycle
~~~

#### Pin Availability by Package

Pins can be defined based on a specific [package context](<%= path "guides/models/modes/#Package" %>)
which can be used to gate their availability.

Here is an example:

~~~ruby
# Initially define the available packages at the top level before adding any pins

class MySoC
  include Origen::TopLevel

  def initialize
    add_package :pkg1
    add_package :pkg2
  end
end
~~~

Pins can then be defined by package:

~~~ruby
add_pin :pin1, packages: :all
add_pin :pin2                           # No constraint is equivalent to :all
add_pin :pin3, package: :pkg2
add_pin :pin4, packages: [:pkg1, :pkg2]

# Pins can also be added within a package scope, these will add to :pkg1 only
with_package :pkg1 do
  add_pin :pin5
  add_pin :pin6
end

# All pins are available when the package is set to nil, no package represents the die
package              # => nil
pins.size            # => 6
package = :pkg1
pins.size            # => 5 (no pin3)
has_pin?(:pin3)      # => false
package = :pkg2
pins.size            # => 4 (no pin5 or pin6)
has_pin?(:pin3)      # => true
~~~

Pin groups can contain different sets of pins in different packages:

~~~ruby
add_pin(:pin1)
add_pin(:pin2)
add_pin(:pin3)

add_pin_group :g1, :pin1, :pin2,        package: :pkg1
add_pin_group :g1, :pin1, :pin2, :pin3, package: :pkg2

has_pins?(:g1)      # => false
pin_groups.size     # => 0

package = :pkg1
has_pins?(:g1)      # => true
pins(:g1).size      # => 2
pin_groups.size     # => 1

package = :pkg2
has_pins?(:g1)      # => true
pins(:g1).size      # => 3
pin_groups.size     # => 1
~~~

#### Package Attributes

The attributes listed in the constant <code>PACKAGE_SCOPED_ATTRIBUTES</code> in the [Pin API](<%= path "api/Origen/Pins/Pin.html" %>)
can be set to specific values per package.

Here is an example of how to set the pin location by package:

~~~ruby
# At definition time
add_pin :pin1, packages: {pkg1: {location: "A2"}, pkg2: {location: "A3"}}
add_pin :pin2

# Or later
pins(:pin2).add_location "A5", package: :pkg1
pins(:pin2).add_location "B2", package: :pkg2

package = :pkg1
pins(:pin1).location       # => "A2"
pins(:pin2).location       # => "A5"

package = :pkg2
pins(:pin1).location       # => "A3"
pins(:pin2).location       # => "B2"
~~~

A context can also be supplied when reading such attributes to override the current context:

~~~ruby
package = :pkg1
pins(:pin1).location                   # => "A2"
pins(:pin1).location(package: :pkg2)   # => "A3"
~~~

Origen will automatically create an alias for the given location (a lower cased symbol) that is scoped to the package.

~~~ruby
package = :pkg1
has_pin?(:a2)              # => true
has_pin?(:a3)              # => false
package = :pkg2
has_pin?(:a2)              # => false
has_pin?(:a3)              # => true
~~~

Certain types of metadata only become available at distinct times in a product lifecycle, for example Device Interface Board (DIB) information.
Depending on when the pin model is constructed the user can specify the DIB metadata in two ways:

~~~ruby
# All at once
$dut.add_pin :tdi, packages: { bga: { location: 'BF2', dib_meta: { channel: 100106, connection: "PE117.08", slot: "PE117", spring_pin: "08" } } }

# Over time
$dut.add_pin :tdi, packages: { bga: { location: 'BF2' } }
$dut.pins(:tdi).add_dib_meta :bga, { channel: 100106, connection: "PE117.08", slot: "PE117", spring_pin: "08" }
~~~

#### Pin Functions

Pin aliases are an example of modelling different pin functions that can be mux'd onto the same pin, in this case
the pin attributes are the same regardless of the function name being used.

However sometimes it is necessary to model different attributes depending on the pin function - for example under
one function the pin may be an input, but when used as another function it is an output.

The attributes listed in the constant <code>FUNCTION_SCOPED_ATTRIBUTES</code> in the [Pin API](<%= path "api/Origen/Pins/Pin.html" %>)
can be set to specific values per context (mode and/or configuration).

If any of these function-scoped attributes are a hash then the function-specific value will be merged with any
default value that has been defined on the pin. This allows the function to override default values and inherit
default values for attributes that it doesn't care about.
Look at the meta data in the example below to see this in action.


Here is an example of adding a function:

~~~ruby
class MySoC
  include Origen::TopLevel

  def initialize
    add_pin :pin1
    add_pin :pin2, meta: { vol: 0.4, voh: 0.6 }   # Example of default meta data

    # Define some pin functions
    pin(:pin1).add_function :nvm_fail, direction: :output
    pin(:pin2).add_function :nvm_done, direction: :output, meta: { voh: 0.7 }  # Override some of the meta data
    pin(:pin1).add_function :tdi, direction: :input
    pin(:pin2).add_function :tdo, direction: :output

    # Add some groupings that are associated with specific pin functions
    add_pin_group :jtag, :tdi, :tdo
    add_pin_group :nvm,  :nvm_fail, :nvm_done
  end
end

$dut = MySoC.new

# The name used to look up a pin now returns the pin with a thin wrapper around it
# which defines its current function:
$dut.pin(:nvm_fail).direction    # => :output
$dut.pin(:nvm_done).direction    # => :output
$dut.pin(:tdi).direction         # => :input
$dut.pin(:tdo).direction         # => :output

# If a function name is given when defining a pin group, the pin will always have
# that function when it is accessed through the resultant group
$dut.pins(:jtag)[0].direction    # => :output
$dut.pins(:jtag)[1].direction    # => :input
$dut.pins(:nvm)[0].direction     # => :output
$dut.pins(:nvm)[1].direction     # => :output

# The pin's meta data can be overridden by function
$dut.pin(:tdo).meta         # => { vol: 0.4, voh: 0.6 }
$dut.pin(:nvm_done).meta    # => { vol: 0.4, voh: 0.7 }
~~~

#### Pin Clock Functionality

The API supports creating a free-running clock on any existing pin, where the timing parameters
of the clock can be specified and vector generation (in relation to the current tester timeset)
will be automatically handled.  See the Pin Clock API below.

##### enable_clock(options)

Enable the clock functionality on a given pin.  Does not start the clock, only sets up
its internally tracked parameters.  Clock can be specified in cycles, time, or frequency

~~~ruby
$dut.pin(:pin1).enable_clock(period_in_ns: 200)       # create free-running clock with 200ns period
$dut.pin(:pin2).enable_clock(frequency_in_khz: 32)    # create 32Khz free-running clock
~~~

##### start_clock(options = {})

Start an existing clock or create and start a free-running clock on a given pin

~~~ruby
$dut.pin(:pin2).start_clock                           # start up existing clock pin2
$dut.pin(:pin3).start_clock(period_in_us: 2)          # create and start clock with 2us period
~~~

##### stop_clock, pause_clock

Stop the clock running on a given pin

~~~ruby
$dut.pin(:pin1).stop_clock                            # stop clock on pin1
$dut.pin(:pin2).pause_clock                           # stop clock on pin2
$dut.pin(:pin3).pause_clock                           # stop clock on pin3
~~~

##### resume_clock(options = {})

Restart an existing clock.  Can be restarted with existing parameters or restarted with a new clock setup

~~~ruby
$dut.pin(:pin2).resume_clock                         # resume clocking on pin2 with existing clock setup
$dut.pin(:pin3).resume_clock(period_in_ns: 100)      # resume clocking on pin3 with new clock parameters
~~~

Some addtional examples:

~~~ruby

# Create timeset with 2-ns period
$tester.set_timeset('ts_50Mhz', 20)      # timeset period is 20ns

# In this example, we enable (without immediately starting) a clock pin with
#   100ns period and then pause, resume, and stop later in the pattern.
$dut.pin(:pin1).enable_clock(period_in_ns: 100)
$dut.pin(:pin1).start_clock
...
$dut.pin(:pin1).pause_clock
...
$dut.pin(:pin1).resume_clock
...
$dut.pin(:pin1).stop_clock
...

# In this example, we start free-running clock with 200ns period, then later stop
#   and restart with a different (100ns period) setup.
$dut.pin(:pin2).start_clock(period_in_ns: 200)
...
$dut.pin(:pin2).stop_clock
...
$dut.pin(:pin2).start_clock(period_in_ns: 100)
...
$dut.pin(:pin2).stop_clock
...
~~~
